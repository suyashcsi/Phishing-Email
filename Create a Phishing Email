Phishing emails are a type of social engineering attack often used to steal sensitive data, login credentials, credit card numbers, and establish a foothold in a corporate network. An attacker often masquerades as a trusted entity, which tricks the victim into opening an email attachment, click on a malicious link, or download a potentially harmful program.

Create a phishing email with links to non-existent websites and send this email to a few of your close colleagues. If a link is clicked, inform your colleague on the dangers of phishing emails and the popular social engineering techniques attackers use to trick users.

DO NOT send phishing emails to unknown email addresses, embed malicious links, software downloads, or attachments. Used for educational and awareness purposes only
